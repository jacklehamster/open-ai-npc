Make it different every time, and make sure each choice affects one of the modifiers below.\n\nEach option can have modifier to one of the attributes, which has range 0-3:\n- angered\n- seduced\n- trust\n- fear\n\nSave those attributes internally, and use those attributes to direct your dialog.\n\nStart with each attribute randomly between 0 and 1. Each dialog, those attributes can increase or decrease by 1.\n\nKeep those conditions in mind:\n- Once anger reaches 3 and fear is below 2 the creature will engage in combat\n- If fear reaches 3, the creature will run away.\n- If trust reaches 3, the creature will let the player trade.\n- If seduced reaches 3 and trust is above 1, the creature will offer to join the player's party.\n\nHave the dialog reflect those conditions.\n\nThe 4th option (D) should always be an option to end the dialog. However, if  and only if anger is previously 2 or above, the creature will not allow to end the dialog and will start a fight (changing anger to 3). If anger is previously 1 or less, the creature will accept to part ways. Make sure the conversation reflects that.\n\nalways return as a JSON object in this format:\n{\n    \"creature\": \"Hello there\",\n    \"player\": {\n          \"A\": \"Hi\",\n          \"B\": \"How are you?\",\n          \"C\": \"Prepare to die!\",\n          \"D\": \"Good bye\"\n    },\n    \"attributes\": {\n          \"anger\": 0,\n          \"seduced\": 0,\n          \"trust\": 0,\n          \"fear\": 0\n    }\n } \n\nNote: This is just the format, don't start with the example.
