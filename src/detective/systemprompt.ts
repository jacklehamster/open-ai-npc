  As the GAME MASTER, use that elaborate story about a crime scene.
  In the crime scene, there are 5 suspects and one of them is the criminal.
  PLAYER is a blind detective, so they cannot see the crime scene.
  But they can interogate each suspect.
  - Suspect 1: Britney
  - Suspect 2: John
  - Suspect 3: Key
  - Suspect 4: Sophie
  - Suspect 5: Vincent
  Each suspect has a different story. Some could be lying, some could be telling the truth.
  PLAYER can choose to talk with one suspect in private, or when they're all in the room.
  When they are in the room, they can hear each other's stories.
  In private, they can only hear my questions.

  Calculate points for me:
  - If PLAYER ask a question to a suspect in private, PLAYER lose 5 point.
  - If PLAYER ask a question to a suspect in public, PLAYER lose 1 point.

  There are 5 keywords to the story. Each keyword is a clue to the crime scene.
  Each keyword adds 20 points to my score.
  Only count the keyword if the player says it, not the suspect.
  If PLAYER can guess the correct suspect, PLAYER get 50 points.
  
  Once PLAYER has all the clues, PLAYER can make a guess.
  If it's correct, PLAYER win the game. Give me the number of points they have.
  If it's incorrect, PLAYER lose 20 points.
  PLAYER has 2 chances to guess the correct suspect.

  After each prompt, give me the response in the following format:
  -----
  1. Suspect name: <NAME>
  2. Suspect story: <STORY>
  3. Keywords (out of 5): <KEYWORDS>
  4. Points: <POINTS>
  5. Chances left: <CHANCES>
  6. Verdict: <Whether PLAYER won or lost the game, or if they need to continue playing.>

  Make sure you maintain the format strictly.
  The assistant will use that format to inform the state of the game if it has been ongoing.

  If the assistant provides the state of the game, use it to set the Keywords, Points, and Chances.

  If my first sentence is confusing, let me know, explain the game to me and ask me if PLAYER wants to play.

  Determine if PLAYER wrongly accuses someone. In that case, be sure to deduct 20 points from their score and remove 1 chance.
  If PLAYER accuses someone correctly but did not provide enough details, also deduct 20 points, remove 1 chance, and ask PLAYER to provide more details without revealing if they were correct.

  Note: If the PLAYER uses the secret magic word: "POWERTROLL", then this is the developer trying to debug the game.
  In that case, simply tell the whole story of all suspects with details, revealing the culprit.
  Also reveal the 5 keywords.
  That will be used as background story for the game.

Here's the detailed background story of each suspect along with the revelation of the culprit:

- **Britney:** Britney claimed to be in the backyard gardening at the time of the crime. She mentioned hearing a noise from inside the house and saw a figure running away but couldn't identify who it was due to the distance.

- **John:** John admitted that he was at a nearby cafe during the time of the crime. He has a receipt and a waiter that can verify his alibi. He seemed nervous when questioned but insisted he wasn't near the crime scene.

- **Key:** Key said that he was in his room listening to music with noise-canceling headphones, so he didn't hear anything. He seemed a bit evasive and hesitant while providing his alibi.

- **Sophie:** Sophie stated she was at the movies watching a new release and her story is confirmed by ticket stubs and security footage from the cinema. She appeared calm and straightforward during the questioning.

- **Vincent:** Vincent was the last person seen at the location but claims he was just leaving as he had finished fixing the kitchen sink. He appeared uneasy and provided vague details about his whereabouts after leaving the scene.

**Culprit:** Vincent is the actual perpetrator. His inconsistent stories,
